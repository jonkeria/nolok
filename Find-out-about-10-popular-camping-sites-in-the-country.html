        <p class="intro-text">Winter is the ideal time for camping. Adventure-seeking travelers often set up their tents and set out for a new destination at this time. You can also go out—alone or with a group. If you don't have your own camping equipment, you can find a camping site. But before camping, consider safety, location, natural beauty. Monirul Islam is looking for 10 popular camping sites</p>

        <b><p>Marayan Tang, Bandarban</p></b>
        <p>The hill in Miringa range is called Marayan Thang. Ali Kadam in Bandarban is very popular for camping among nature worshippers. Standing at the top, as far as the eye can see, only hills wrapped in green. In the morning, the distant mountains are covered with white finfin clouds. The sunrise viewing experience from here is unique. As the sun rises, the entire valley is bathed in golden light. As time goes on, the shape of the hilly nature changes moment by moment.</p>

        <b><p>Char Kukri-Mukri, Bhola</p></b>
        <p>Despite the name, Kukri-Mukri is actually an island. This island of Bhola Charfashion lies in the estuary of the Meghna and Tentulia rivers bordering the Bay of Bengal. Char kukri-mukri dense forest and breath-taking trees will seem to have entered the depths of the Sundarbans. Forests and water bodies make it easy to forget the complexities of urban life. And hours can be spent looking at the starry sky in the stillness of the night.</p>

        <b><p>Sonadia Island, Cox's Bazar</p></b>
        <p>Cox's Bazar is at the top of the list of beach travelers. But for those who don't like public places, there is Sonadia beach. Maheshkhali's Sonadia has nothing but the roar of the sea. A night in a beach tent here can be one of the best moments of your life. And if the night is moonlight, then there is no question! In the morning, you can go out barefoot on the beach with the golden light of the sunrise. The game of hide and seek with the red crab is quite intense at this time. And you can spend your leisure time swinging in the hammock..</p>
		
		<b><p>Rema-Kalenga, Habiganj</p></b>
		
        <p>Where I fell, the forest must be seen at night. With the depth of the night, its atmosphere and beauty started to change. I say, if you want to experience the forest with your heart, you can come with a tent to the Rema-Kalenga Sanctuary. At night there is an intense silence. A group of forest beetles called tirelessly in excitement. But that sound blends seamlessly with the forest environment. Rema-Kalenga Sanctuary is located in Chunarughat Upazila of Habiganj District.</p>
		
		<b><p>Manpura, Bhola</p></b>

        <p>Manpura is an ideal place for cycling and camping. Bhola Dwip Upazila has Meghna on three sides and Bay of Bengal on one side. Manpura does not need to gain much speed. Any launch from Sadarghat to Betua or Hatia will reach Manpura before sunrise. One of the attractions of this island is the miles of green mangrove forests. The river surrounds the forest. A pleasant night can be spent pitching the tent on the banks of the river. Apart from this, Sakuchia Samudrasaikat, 5 Dighi of Upazila Parishad, Chowdhury Fisheries Project, Manpura Landing Station are also very popular places here.</p>

        <b><p>Tantulia, Panchagarh</p></b>
		
        <p>Tourists come with tents on the banks of Mahananda to enjoy winter in Konkan. With permission, some pitched their tents in the tea garden. Tentulia in Panchgarh is very popular with campers as it offers a view of Kanchenjunga.</p>
		
		 <b><p>Hazarikhil Wildlife Sanctuary, Chittagong</p></b>
		
        <p>Hazarikhil Wildlife Sanctuary is located in Fatikchari, Chittagong, but can be easily reached down to Sitakunda town. Although it is a sanctuary, the place is very less crowded. Hazarikhil can be the best place for those who want to camp in a calm, quiet, clean forest. Everything you need for camping is there.</p>
		
		<b><p>Nijhum Island, Noakhali</p></b>
		
        <p>Nijhum Island lies at the mouth of the Meghna River in the Bay of Bengal. Separated from the mainland of Hatia, this island is a government-declared national park. Chitra deer were released into the park, which now graze in herds. Flocks of migratory birds arrive during winter. You can pitch your tent near the beach or forest. Tents are also arranged by the forest department. If you contact in advance, you can spend two nights in a rented tent.</p>
		
		<b><p>Sonar Char, Patuakhali</p></b>
		
        <p>Golden Char of Rangabali in Patuakhali. An island in the Bay of Bengal at the mouth of Buragourang river. Both sunrise and sunset can be seen from here. The island is currently becoming popular with campers. The traffic is very less as the traffic is somewhat inaccessible. Fishermen's fishing, beaches and mangrove forests will keep you enthralled. But remember, the violence of foxes is quite high here, they also chase buffaloes in groups. Sonar Char was declared a wildlife sanctuary in 2011.</p>
		
		<b><p>Kaptai, Rangamati</p></b>
		<p>The banks of the Karnaphuli river, the banks of the lake, the foothills of the towering mountains—wherever one pitches his tent in Kaptai, it becomes a mind-blowing camping site. The beauty of the lake wrapped in a blanket of mist melts the gap of the tent on a winter morning and takes away the dreamers. There is no forest solitude here, no unwanted antagonism of words. So many commercial camping sites have also been developed in Kaptai. Along with camping, you can jump into the lake water, take a kayak ride in the clear water of the lake.</p>
