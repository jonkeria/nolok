        <p class="intro-text">Annapurna Basecamp from Pokhara, Nepal—a 10-day trek in all. The path is difficult, but full of otherLifestylely beauty. This beauty of Himalayan nature makes you forget the difficulty of reaching the destination. How much more is that visual! Iftekharul Islam has walked on this mountain path in May  . He is writing that experience serially. Read the eighth episode today</p>

        <p>It doesn't take long to pack everything back at camp. I am ready with my bag and backpack around six o'clock after breakfast. I asked guide Tej, can't we go out now without having breakfast here so early in the morning? Tej said, it is a very good decision. From here we will reach Machhapuchar basecamp after one and a half hour walk. Breakfast can be served there. Almost all those starting the return trek from here today will spend the night at Dovan or Bambu. If we leave now and can walk at a normal pace, we will end the day by going to Lower Sinuwa if possible. The next day will be a relatively short trek. I will reach Jhinu in three to four hours. There are hot springs. Beautiful green hills around.</p>

        <p>Jhinu is the next day's goal, but think about it later. Now leave Annapurna Basecamp and start our journey back. All around is sparkling white from last night's snowfall. The dazzling whiteness of the morning sun fell on it. I didn't know it could be so brightly sunny all around at half past six in the morning. The sunglasses that I have been wearing since yesterday morning, I put them on again this morning. Sometimes I need glasses, but I can't take off my sunglasses. At this height of the mountain, walking in such snow country requires category III or IV sunglasses with polarized lenses. These sunglasses allow only 8 to 10 percent of light to enter.</p>

        <p>After a short walk I realized that it was a very ambitious goal and a bold decision to trek from here to Lower Sinuwa in one day. Descending the mountain path is not always easy. At the time of descent, you have to climb uphill in many places. And the pressure on the front of the foot, especially on the big toe, when going downhill over the rocks, can sometimes take a very bad clinical form.</p>
		
		<p>I already walk slowly. When the pain in the toe becomes excruciating, my walking pace becomes very slow. My toenails have been damaged before after the trek. Same situation this time too. Tej does not understand why he is walking so slowly. He can never walk at a normal pace when he comes with me. So I feel a little bad for him. I don't feel like eating anything at lunch today. But how can I walk such a long way without playing enough? After a while, everyone eats protein bars and dates out of the backpack.</p>
		
		<p>After lunch break, I took off my boots and socks and applied Move Spray on both big toes. The pain is slightly reduced. It is very temporary. However, I can walk for a while because of the temporary relief. Then the pain comes back. It was difficult while walking, but I did not realize how much damage was done to the feet, especially the toes.</p>

        <p>In the afternoon it was realized that I would not be able to reach Lower Sinuwa before evening. The path to be passed in the darkness of the evening is the most difficult part of the day. One hour steepest ascent and half an hour steepest descent. In the end, I noticed that it was getting less difficult to climb higher. Going down is more difficult. I finally turned around and went down one step at a time as my toes hurt while stepping forward. Tej went some distance and stood for me.</p>
		
		 <p>Already away from the towns and remote mountain paths in the lonely silence met with himself anew; Various thoughts started buzzing in the mind. No one will ever be told how many thoughts come to mind while walking here alone all day. Met many trekkers on the way till noon. Hi, hello, namaste—such greetings are exchanged. After noon, the trekking route became uncrowded. Against the background of such a big mountain, I am all alone in the peaceful silence.</p>
		
		<p>Mountain peaks, some unfulfilled dreams and unknown thirsts pull me. After reaching the goal, I came back with wonderful memories. Can't even walk very fast. He felt a little upset because of the severe pain in his legs and the very slow pace. I try to remove that sadness with the memory of coming to see Annapurna. Now no matter how hard it is, I have reached another most beautiful destination of the Himalayas, I have seen the magnificent Annapurna. A peace of mind.</p>
